## Integration with Core Technical Components

The OPTIM-FRAMEWORK seamlessly integrates with the existing technical components:

### Configuration Management
```python
# Framework configuration integration
from ampel360_utils import AMPEL360Config

config = AMPEL360Config()

# Organizational integration
governance = config.get_governance_structure()
financial = config.get_financial_parameters()

# Procedural integration
current_phase = config.get_current_phase()
gate_criteria = config.get_gate_criteria()

# Technological integration
architecture = config.get_architecture()
components = config.get_component_mapping()

# Machine learning integration
ml_config = config.get_ml_configuration()
simulation_params = config.get_simulation_parameters()
```

### QAOA Optimization Enhancement
The framework enhances the existing QAOA optimization with enterprise-level capabilities:

```python
# Enhanced QAOA with framework integration
class EnterpriseQAOA(QAOASelector):
    def __init__(self, constraints_path, candidates_path):
        super().__init__(constraints_path, candidates_path)
        self.governance = GovernanceFramework()
        self.procedures = ProceduralFramework()
        self.technology = TechnologicalFramework()
        self.ml_framework = MachineLearningFramework()
    
    def enterprise_optimization(self):
        """Run optimization with full enterprise framework"""
        # Governance validation
        self.governance.validate_stakeholder_alignment()
        
        # Procedural compliance
        self.procedures.execute_phase_gate_check()
        
        # Technological validation
        self.technology.validate_component_integration()
        
        # ML enhancement
        enhanced_result = self.ml_framework.enhance_optimization(
            super().optimize_qnnn()
        )
        
        return enhanced_result
```
