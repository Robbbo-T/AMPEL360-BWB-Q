## Framework Sections

- **O-ORGANIZATIONAL**  
  Governance, financial control, strategic management, and organizational structures.

- **P-PROCEDURAL**  
  Processes, workflows, phase gates, and enterprise standards.

- **T-TECHNOLOGICAL**  
  Detailed technical architecture breakdown with all component architectures (CAs) and configuration items (CIs).

- **I-INTELLIGENT**  
  AI models, optimization algorithms (QAOA/classical), predictive analytics, decision support systems.

- **M-MACHINE**  
  Simulation models, digital twin capabilities, co-simulation, and hardware-in-the-loop testing.

## UTCS Structure (applies to every CI)

Each **Configuration Item (CI)** maintains the 11 canonical UTCS phases:

```

UTCS-01-Requirements/
UTCS-02-Design/
UTCS-03-Building-Prototyping/
UTCS-04-Executables-Packages/
UTCS-05-Verification-Validation/
UTCS-06-Integration-Qualification/
UTCS-07-Certification-Security/
UTCS-08-Production-Scale/
UTCS-09-Ops-Services/
UTCS-10-MRO/
UTCS-11-Sustainment-Recycle/

```

Artifacts are stored **as code** (YAML/JSON, analyses, test logs), with traceability from requirements to certification-security.
