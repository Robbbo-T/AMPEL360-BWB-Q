# 🛠️ AMPEL360-BWB-Q — Application Ecosystem

Welcome to the `/app/` layer of **AMPEL360-BWB-Q**.  
This is the **Application Ecosystem Hub**, providing a **navigable index** of all software modules supporting the **design, development, certification, and operations** of the AMPEL360 Blended-Wing-Body hydrogen aircraft.

## 📂 Application Index

| Application | Domain | Description | Status |
|-------------|--------|-------------|--------|
| [CQEA_Classical_Quantum-Extensible_Applications](./CQEA_Classical_Quantum-Extensible_Applications) | Cross-domain (Optimization, AI/ML, Quantum) | Implements hybrid **classical–quantum workflows** for simulation, optimization, and digital twin synchronization. Includes MDGPT for 2D→ontology→3D transformation. | ✅ Active |
| `QNS_Navigation/` | Avionics & Flight Ops | Quantum Navigation System: entangled-photon and cold-atom navigation algorithms. | 🚧 Planned |
| `FbQW_Control/` | Flight Control Systems | Fly-by-Quantum-Wire control laws and redundancy management. | 🚧 Planned |
| `AGEN_QAI_Doc/` | Documentation & Compliance | Automated S1000D/UTCS-compliant technical document generation. | 🚧 Planned |
| `MRO_DigitalTwin/` | Maintenance & Ops | AI-augmented digital twin for predictive maintenance and MRO scheduling. | 🚧 Planned |

## 🌌 Purpose of `/app/`

- Central **entry point** for the AMPEL360 application ecosystem.  
- Ensures **traceability across UTCS-MI v5.0 phases** (Requirements → Design → Production → Ops → MRO → Recycle).  
- Provides **navigable links** to application packages.  
- Supports **continuous integration** between core framework and operational layers.  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone and explore:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Robbbo-T/AMPEL360-BWB-Q.git
cd AMPEL360-BWB-Q/app
```

Each application has its own README.md with setup, usage, and compliance details.

---

## 📑 Standards & Compliance

All applications in `/app` must follow:

- **UTCS-MI v5.0** naming & lifecycle mapping.
- Documentation in **Markdown + YAML** (machine & human readable).
- Integration with **AQUA V. frameworks** (AGEN-QAI, QAUDIT, DT-TRACE).
- Explicit tagging of domains: `{AIR, SPACE, DEFENSE, GROUND, CROSS}`.

---

## 🔮 Roadmap

- [x] Populate navigation index with live links to new apps.
- [ ] Add Mermaid-based ecosystem map for visualization.
- [ ] Integrate interactive dashboard (via AMPEL360 platform).
- [ ] Automate documentation generation with AGEN-QAI.

This `/app/` hub evolves as the aircraft program evolves — from initial CQEA experiments to full operational digital twins and beyond.
