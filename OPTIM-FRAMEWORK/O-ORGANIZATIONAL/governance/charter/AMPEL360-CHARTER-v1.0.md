## 1. Program Overview

The AMPEL360 H₂-BWB-Q program is a comprehensive aircraft configuration optimization framework focused on Blended Wing Body (BWB) aircraft with hydrogen propulsion systems and quantum-inspired optimization techniques.

## 2. Program Objectives

### Primary Objectives
- Develop and validate BWB aircraft configurations with hydrogen propulsion

- Determine optimal passenger capacity (QNNN) using CVaR optimization

### Success Criteria
- Achieve TRL 6+ for core BWB subsystems in P2 phase
- Generate feasible configuration set meeting all hard constraints
- Implement functional CVaR risk optimization (α=0.8, β=0.25)
- Validate hydrogen propulsion integration with BWB architecture

## 3. Scope and Boundaries

### In Scope
