## Integration with Technical Framework

### Configuration Management Integration
```python
# Organizational oversight integration
from ampel360_utils import AMPEL360Config

config = AMPEL360Config()

# Governance validation
governance_status = config.validate_governance_compliance()
stakeholder_approval = config.get_stakeholder_approvals()

# Financial oversight
budget_status = config.get_budget_performance()
cost_variance = config.calculate_cost_variance()

# Performance monitoring
kpi_dashboard = config.get_kpi_status()
milestone_progress = config.get_milestone_progress()
```
