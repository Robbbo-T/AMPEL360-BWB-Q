# Aircraft Useful Life Management — AMPEL360 H₂-BWB

This directory contains the complete document set for managing aircraft useful life according to ARP4754A standards.

## Document Structure

### O-ORGANIZATIONAL (Policy Level)
- **[Service-Life-Policy-BWB-H2.md](policies/Service-Life-Policy-BWB-H2.md)** — Corporate policy defining LOV targets (30→35→40→45 years) and gate criteria
- **[cert-readiness-index.yaml](../kpis/cert-readiness-index.yaml)** — KPI definition for certification readiness tracking

### P-PROCEDURAL (Process Level)
- **[Service-Life-Extension-Procedure.md](../P-PROCEDURAL/processes/Service-Life-Extension-Procedure.md)** — Execution workflow for life extensions
- **Gate Dossiers:**
  - **[Gate-M/dossier.yaml](../P-PROCEDURAL/gates/Gate-M/dossier.yaml)** — Mid-life extension (→35 years)
  - **[Gate-X1/dossier.yaml](../P-PROCEDURAL/gates/Gate-X1/dossier.yaml)** — First major extension (→40 years)  
  - **[Gate-X2/dossier.yaml](../P-PROCEDURAL/gates/Gate-X2/dossier.yaml)** — Final extension (→45 years)

## Key Features

### Service Life Policy (O-ORGANIZATIONAL)
- **Target:** 45-year service life with evidence-based gate approach
- **Gates:** Gate-M (12-15y → 35y), Gate-X1 (24-28y → 40y), Gate-X2 (33-36y → 45y)
- **RACI:** Program Board, Chief Architect, CSE, Segment Leads, Finance, Safety
- **KPIs:** Safety (100% hazards mitigated), Technical (SHM, LPS ≤2.5mΩ), Economic (NPV>0)

### Extension Procedure (P-PROCEDURAL)
- **7-Phase Process:** Planning → Technical Evidence → Safety & Compliance → Economics → Integration Review → Board Decision → Execution
- **Evidence Requirements:** V&V matrices, Safety packs, SHM data, NPV analysis
- **Go/No-Go Criteria:** All KPIs must meet thresholds for gate approval

### Gate Dossiers
Each gate includes:
- **LOV Targets:** 35/40/45 year objectives
- **Upgrade Packages:** CRY refurb, HV recabling, structural reinforcements
- **Evidence Tracking:** Analysis, test, calculations, compliance documents
- **Approval Workflow:** Multi-stakeholder sign-off process

## Integration with UTCS Framework

All documents follow UTCS-MI standards:
- **Phase Alignment:** Integrated with UTCS Phase 09-Maintenance
- **Evidence Traceability:** Links to segment-specific V&V matrices
- **Configuration Control:** YAML metadata with versioning and approval tracking

## Usage

### Policy Review
```bash
# View current policy
cat OPTIM-FRAMEWORK/O-ORGANIZATIONAL/policies/Service-Life-Policy-BWB-H2.md

# Check KPI status
python3 -c "import yaml; print(yaml.safe_load(open('OPTIM-FRAMEWORK/O-ORGANIZATIONAL/kpis/cert-readiness-index.yaml')))"
```

### Gate Preparation
```bash
# Review gate requirements
cat OPTIM-FRAMEWORK/P-PROCEDURAL/processes/Service-Life-Extension-Procedure.md

# Check gate dossier template
python3 -c "import yaml; print(yaml.safe_load(open('OPTIM-FRAMEWORK/P-PROCEDURAL/gates/Gate-M/dossier.yaml')))"
```

### Validation
The documents integrate with existing AMPEL360 validation tools:
```bash
make check-deps  # Verify YAML validation capability
make validate    # Run CI artifact validation
```

## Compliance Standards

- **ARP4754A/4761:** Safety assessment and development assurance
- **CS-25:** Certification specifications for large aircraft
- **DO-160:** Environmental conditions and test procedures
- **ISO-19880:** Hydrogen fuel specifications
- **SAE AIR6464:** Hydrogen aircraft considerations
