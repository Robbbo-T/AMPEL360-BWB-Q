# Monitoring Procedures — AMPEL360 H₂-BWB-Q

**UTCS Phase:** 08-Operations, 09-Ops-Services  
**Owner:** Operations Team, SRE

## Purpose
Comprehensive monitoring procedures for AMPEL360 systems including infrastructure, applications, and business metrics.

## Monitoring Stack

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
- **AlertManager**: Alert routing and notification
- **Node Exporter**: System-level metrics

### Application Monitoring
- **APM Tools**: Distributed tracing with Jaeger
- **Log Aggregation**: ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Custom Metrics**: Business-specific KPIs
- **Health Checks**: Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes

## Key Metrics

### System Metrics
- CPU utilization and load average
- Memory usage and garbage collection
- Disk I/O and space utilization
- Network throughput and latency

### Application Metrics
- Request rate and response time
- Error rates by service and endpoint
- Database connection pool utilization
- Cache hit/miss ratios

### Business Metrics
- Digital twin simulation completion rates
- Model accuracy drift detection
- User session duration
- Feature adoption rates

## Alerting Strategy

### Alert Levels
- **Critical**: Service outage, data corruption
- **Warning**: Performance degradation, resource pressure
- **Info**: Capacity planning, trend notifications

### Alert Routing
```yaml
routes:
  - match:
      severity: critical
    receiver: pagerduty
    group_wait: 10s
    repeat_interval: 5m
  
  - match:
      severity: warning
    receiver: slack
    group_wait: 30s
    repeat_interval: 1h
```

## Dashboard Categories
- Executive summary (high-level KPIs)
- Operations dashboard (system health)
- Development metrics (deployment frequency)
- Business intelligence (user analytics)

## Incident Response
- Automated escalation procedures
- Runbook integration
- Post-incident review process
- Continuous improvement feedback loop
