# Webhook Procedures — AMPEL360 H₂-BWB-Q

**UTCS Phase:** 04-Implementation, 08-Operations  
**Owner:** Integration Team

## Purpose
Standardized procedures for webhook implementation and management in AMPEL360 systems.

## Webhook Types

### 1. Build Notifications
- Trigger: CI/CD pipeline completion
- Payload: Build status, artifacts, test results
- Targets: Slack, email, project management tools

### 2. Model Updates
- Trigger: Digital twin model changes
- Payload: Model version, changes, validation status
- Targets: Downstream systems, notification services

### 3. Alert Webhooks
- Trigger: System anomalies, threshold breaches
- Payload: Alert details, severity, recommended actions
- Targets: Operations center, on-call systems

## Implementation Standards

### Security Requirements
- HTTPS only (TLS 1.2 minimum)
- HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
- API key authentication
- IP allowlist restrictions

### Payload Format
```json
{
  "event_type": "model.updated",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-08T10:30:00Z",
  "source": "ampel360.digital-twin",
  "data": {
    "model_id": "BWB-H2-001",
    "version": "1.2.3",
    "changes": ["geometry", "materials"]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "correlation_id": "uuid-4",
    "retry_count": 0
  }
}
```

### Retry Logic
- Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s)
- Maximum 5 retry attempts
- Dead letter queue for failures
- Circuit breaker pattern

## Testing Procedures
- Webhook endpoint validation
- Payload schema verification
- Timeout and retry testing
- Security penetration testing

## Monitoring and Alerting
- Delivery success rates
- Response time metrics
- Error rate tracking
- Anomaly detection
