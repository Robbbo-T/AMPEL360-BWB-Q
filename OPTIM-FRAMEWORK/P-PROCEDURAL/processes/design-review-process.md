# AMPEL360 H₂-BWB-Q Design Review Process

## Process Overview

The design review process ensures systematic evaluation of aircraft configuration designs throughout the development lifecycle, maintaining technical excellence, safety compliance, and program objectives alignment.

## Design Review Types

### Conceptual Design Review (CDR)
- **Purpose**: Validate initial design concepts and architecture decisions
- **Timing**: End of Phase P1
- **Participants**: Chief Architect, Technical Leads, Program Board
- **Duration**: 2 days
- **Deliverables**: Design concept approval, requirements validation

### Preliminary Design Review (PDR)
- **Purpose**: Review detailed design development and integration plans
- **Timing**: Mid Phase P2 (Current)
- **Participants**: Extended technical team, external experts, stakeholders
- **Duration**: 3 days
- **Deliverables**: Design maturity assessment, integration approval

### Critical Design Review (CCR)
- **Purpose**: Final design approval before implementation
- **Timing**: End of Phase P2
- **Participants**: Full program team, regulatory representatives
- **Duration**: 4 days
- **Deliverables**: Design freeze, implementation authorization

### Operational Design Review (ODR)
- **Purpose**: Validate operational configuration and procedures
- **Timing**: Phase P3
- **Participants**: Operations team, certification authorities
- **Duration**: 2 days
- **Deliverables**: Operational approval, certification readiness
