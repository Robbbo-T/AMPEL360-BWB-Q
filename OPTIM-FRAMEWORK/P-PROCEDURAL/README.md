# P-PROCEDURAL: Procedural Framework

## Overview

The Procedural Framework establishes standardized processes, workflows, phase gates, and quality standards for the AMPEL360 H₂-BWB-Q program. This framework ensures consistent execution, quality assurance, and systematic progression through development phases.

## Core Components

### Processes

- **Change Control Process**: Structured approach to configuration and requirement changes
- **Risk Management Process**: Comprehensive risk identification, assessment, and mitigation
- **Certification Process**: Regulatory compliance and certification progression
- **Security Clearance Process**: Personnel security and access control

### Workflows  
Automated and standardized workflows for efficient program execution.

**Key Workflows:**
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Continuous integration and deployment for software components
- **Release Workflow**: Structured release management and version control
- **Approval Workflow**: Systematic approval processes for decisions and deliverables

### Phase Gates
Structured phase progression with clear criteria and deliverables.

**Phase Structure:**
- **P1-CONSERVATIVE**: [P1-CONSERVATIVE/](gates/P1-CONSERVATIVE/) - Conservative baseline configuration
- **P2-INTRODUCE-BWB**: [P2-INTRODUCE-BWB/](gates/P2-INTRODUCE-BWB/) - BWB introduction and H₂ integration
- **P3-FULL-OPTIMAL**: [P3-FULL-OPTIMAL/](gates/P3-FULL-OPTIMAL/) - Advanced optimization and production readiness

### Standards
Comprehensive standards ensuring quality, consistency, and compliance.

**Key Standards:**
- **Coding Standards**: Software development standards and best practices
- **Documentation Standards**: Comprehensive documentation requirements and templates
- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent naming across all program artifacts
- **Security Standards**: Information security and access control standards

## Integration with Technical Implementation

### QAOA Integration
Procedural framework seamlessly integrates with QAOA optimization:

```python
# Procedural validation in QAOA process
class ProceduralQAOA(QAOASelector):
    def __init__(self, constraints_path, candidates_path):
        super().__init__(constraints_path, candidates_path)
        self.phase_gate = PhaseGateManager()
        self.change_control = ChangeControlSystem()
        self.quality_assurance = QualityAssuranceFramework()
    
    def procedural_optimization(self):
        """Run optimization with procedural compliance"""
        # Phase gate validation
        self.phase_gate.validate_phase_readiness("P2")
        
        # Change control process
        change_request = self.change_control.create_change_request()
        
        # Quality assurance
        self.quality_assurance.pre_optimization_check()
        
        # Execute optimization
        result = super().optimize_qnnn()
        
        # Post-optimization procedures
        self.quality_assurance.post_optimization_validation(result)
        self.change_control.close_change_request(change_request)
        
        return result
```

### Configuration Management Integration
Full integration with AMPEL360 configuration management:

```python
# Procedural configuration management
from ampel360_utils import AMPEL360Config

config = AMPEL360Config()

# Phase gate compliance
current_phase = config.get_current_phase()
gate_criteria = config.get_gate_criteria(current_phase)
compliance_status = config.validate_gate_compliance()

# Process compliance
process_status = config.get_process_compliance()
quality_metrics = config.get_quality_metrics()
```
