- Regulatory requirement changes

## Update Process

### 1. Change Request Initiation
- Document change rationale
- Define scope and impact
- Estimate resources required
- Obtain preliminary approval

### 2. Impact Analysis
- Assess downstream effects
- Identify affected models and simulations
- Determine validation requirements
- Update risk assessment

### 3. Implementation
- Execute model modifications
- Update documentation
- Regenerate dependent artifacts
- Perform integration testing

### 4. Validation & Verification
- Run validation test suite
- Compare against reference data
- Document performance metrics
- Obtain stakeholder sign-off

## Rollback Procedure
- Maintain model version history
- Define rollback triggers
- Execute rollback if needed
- Document lessons learned

## Evidence Documentation
- Change request forms
- Impact analysis reports
- Validation test results
- Approval documentation
