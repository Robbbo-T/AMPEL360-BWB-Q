# Model Synchronization Procedure — AMPEL360 H₂-BWB-Q

**UTCS Phase:** 01-Requirements, 02-Design  
**Owner:** Digital Twin Lead

## Purpose
Maintain synchronization between physical and digital twin models across design phases.

## Procedure Steps

### 1. Change Detection
- Monitor CAD geometry updates
- Track material property changes
- Identify boundary condition modifications

### 2. Impact Assessment
- Evaluate changes against current twin model
- Determine propagation requirements
- Assess computational resource needs

### 3. Synchronization Execution
- Update twin model parameters
- Regenerate mesh if required
- Validate model consistency

### 4. Verification
- Run baseline validation cases
- Compare against reference data
- Document changes and impacts

## Evidence Requirements
- Change logs with timestamps
- Validation test results
- Model comparison reports
- Approval signatures

## Acceptance Criteria
- All models within tolerance thresholds
- No regression in validation metrics
- Complete traceability maintained
