**UTCS Phase:** 04-Implementation, 05-Verification-Validation  
**Owner:** Quality Assurance Team, Development Teams

## Purpose
Comprehensive testing procedures to ensure software quality, reliability, and compliance with aviation standards.

## Test Strategy

### Test Pyramid
```
    /\
   /UI\     <- End-to-End Tests (10%)
  /____\
 /      \
/        \   <- Integration Tests (20%)
\        /
 \______/
/        \
\        /   <- Unit Tests (70%)
 \______/
```

### Test Types

#### Unit Tests
- **Scope**: Individual functions/methods
- **Framework**: pytest (Python), Jest (JavaScript)
- **Coverage**: ≥85% line coverage
- **Execution**: Every commit via CI/CD

#### Integration Tests
- **Scope**: Component interactions
- **Tools**: TestContainers, WireMock
- **Focus**: API contracts, database interactions
- **Execution**: Daily automated runs

#### System Tests
- **Scope**: End-to-end workflows
- **Tools**: Selenium, Playwright
- **Focus**: User journeys, business scenarios
- **Execution**: Pre-release validation

#### Performance Tests
- **Scope**: Load, stress, endurance
- **Tools**: JMeter, k6, Gatling
- **Metrics**: Response time, throughput, resource usage
- **Execution**: Weekly baseline runs

#### Security Tests
- **Scope**: Vulnerabilities, penetration
- **Tools**: OWASP ZAP, SonarQube
- **Focus**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Execution**: Every release cycle

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Categories
- **Synthetic**: Generated test data
- **Anonymized**: Production data with PII removed
- **Static**: Fixed datasets for regression tests
- **Dynamic**: Generated for specific test scenarios

### Data Refresh Strategy
```yaml
environments:
  development:
    refresh_frequency: "daily"
    data_sources: ["synthetic", "static"]
  staging:
    refresh_frequency: "weekly"
    data_sources: ["anonymized", "synthetic"]
  production:
    refresh_frequency: "never"
    data_sources: ["live"]
```

## Test Environment Management

### Environment Types
- **Local**: Developer workstations
- **CI**: Continuous integration pipelines
- **Staging**: Pre-production validation
- **Production**: Live environment

### Environment Configuration
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Containerized applications (Docker/Kubernetes)
- Configuration management (Ansible)
- Monitoring and observability

## Test Reporting

### Metrics Tracked
- Test execution results
- Code coverage percentages
- Defect detection rates
- Test execution times
- Environment stability

### Dashboards
- Real-time test execution status
- Trend analysis over time
- Quality gate compliance
- Release readiness indicators

## Regulatory Compliance

### DO-178C (Software Considerations)
- Requirements-based testing
- Structural coverage analysis
- Modified condition/decision coverage
- Traceability matrix maintenance

### ISO 26262 (Functional Safety)
- Hazard analysis and risk assessment
