Abstract

This paper formalizes a model‑based, executable doctrine for complex aeronautical systems engineering that couples: (i) a domain taxonomy—the AMEDEO‑PELLICCIA methodology—that makes large, multi‑disciplinary programs tractable, with (ii) a life‑cycle process—UTCS, a set of 11 canonical phases spanning requirements through sustainment and recycling, and (iii) an optimization pipeline that enumerates a certifiable feasible set and selects architectures via risk‑aware quantum/classical optimization. We instantiate the doctrine on a hydrogen‑propelled Blended Wing Body (BWB) program, AMPEL360‑H₂‑BWB‑Q, and show how requirements, verification, and governance artifacts are rendered as code (YAML/JSON), enabling audit‑ready traceability from initial requirements to digital packages and certification security cases. The manuscript contributes (a) a formal semantics for UTCS phases and artifacts, (b) an executable work‑breakdown mapped to the AMEDEO‑PELLICCIA domains, and (c) a mathematically precise selector using an E[cost] + β·CVaR_α(cost) objective solved over a feasible set \mathcal{F} via QAOA or classical surrogates.

Keywords: UTCS, MBSE, ARP4754A/4761, BWB, hydrogen aviation, QAOA, CVaR, digital twin, certification security, executable requirements.

1. Introduction

Modern aerospace programs confront simultaneous pressures: decarbonization (e.g., liquid hydrogen), radical geometries (e.g., BWB), and highly coupled ecosystems (airports, supply chains, cyber‑physical attack surfaces). Traditional document‑centric methods struggle to keep pace, leading to ambiguities, late design churn, and certification surprises. We present an executable systems engineering doctrine that integrates a domain taxonomy, a canonical life‑cycle, and a risk‑aware optimizer into a single, auditable pipeline.

Our thesis is twofold: first, program‑level order arises from a complete, non‑overlapping domain decomposition (AMEDEO‑PELLICCIA); second, end‑to‑end rigor requires a canonical life‑cycle with machine‑checkable entry/exit criteria (UTCS—11 phases). With these foundations, optimization becomes tractable: we enumerate feasible, certifiable architectures and select a risk‑optimal design using tail‑risk aware objectives.

2. Contributions
	1.	Methodological formalization. We formalize the AMEDEO‑PELLICCIA domain taxonomy and its binding to configuration architectures (CAs) and configuration items (CIs).
	2.	Canonical life‑cycle. We define UTCS—11 phases, each with precise inputs, artifacts, and exit criteria that are representable as code.
	3.	Optimization over certifiability. We define a feasible‑first pipeline:
\[
\mathcal{F}=\{x\in\mathcal{X}\mid \texttt{hard\constraints}(x)=\text{true}\}\quad\rightarrow\quad
x^*=\arg\min{x\in\mathcal{F}}\ \mathbb{E}[H(x)] + \beta\,\mathrm{CVaR}_\alpha\!\big(H(x)\big)
\]
and implement the selector with QAOA or a classical surrogate.
	4.	Executable traceability. We show how requirements (e.g., CI‑CA‑A‑001‑001‑CB‑PRIMARY‑GRID) are represented, verified, and frozen in UTCS 01‑Requirements, with a complete V&V matrix and standards mapping.

3. Background and Related Norms

Our doctrine interfaces with established aerospace standards for development and safety assessment (e.g., ARP4754A, ARP4761), airworthiness (e.g., CS/FAR‑25 families), environmental/electromagnetic qualification (e.g., DO‑160), lightning protection (e.g., ARP5412/5414/5416), hydrogen infrastructure and materials compatibility (e.g., ISO‑19880, ISO‑11114‑4), and material allowables (e.g., CMH‑17, MMPDS). We do not replace these norms; we bind them into an executable pipeline with explicit artifacts, tests, and acceptance criteria.

4. The AMEDEO‑PELLICCIA Methodology (Domain Taxonomy)

4.1 Rationale

A large aerospace program is an entangled graph of domains. The AMEDEO‑PELLICCIA taxonomy provides a complete and non‑overlapping partition that serves as the program’s ontology and as the schema for all artifacts.

4.2 Domains

Architecture; Mechanical; Environmental; Digital; Energy; Operations; Propulsion; Electronics; Logistics; Links; Infrastructures; Control; Cryogenics; Intelligence; Airports.

Each domain contains Configuration Architectures (CAs) decomposed into Configuration Items (CIs) with unique IDs (e.g., CA‑A‑001 Center‑Body Box → CI‑CA‑A‑001‑001 Primary Grid). Artifacts (requirements, designs, ICDs, tests) are stored as code and versioned.

⸻

5. UTCS—11 Canonical Phases (Process Semantics)

We formalize UTCS as an ordered set of 11 phases with partial concurrency across CIs. Each phase has deterministic entry inputs, required artifacts, machine‑checkable exit criteria, and review gates.

Phase	Name	Primary Objective	Typical Gate	Minimal Exit Artifacts
01	Requirements	Stakeholder needs → shall requirements; V&V strategy	SRR	Baseline requirements (YAML), standards mapping, V&V matrix seed
02	Design	Functional/logical/physical design; item requirements	PDR/CDR	Architecture models, ICDs, FEM/CFD pre‑sizes, item REQs
03	Building‑Prototyping	Prototypes, coupons, rigs, breadboards	BRR	Build records, test rigs, prototype BoMs, as‑built deltas
04	Executables‑Packages	Software/firmware/toolchains, data packages	SW/HW PR	Reproducible builds, binaries/containers, data packs, checksum SBOMs
05	Verification‑Validation	Evidence vs. shall; operational validation	TR/VR	Test reports, analyses, inspection records, validation reports
06	Integration‑Qualification	System integration; environmental/EMC/lightning qual	IRR/QR	Integrated test logs, qualification evidence, conformity records
07	Certification‑Security	Compliance statements; safety & cyber cases	CR/ASR	Compliance matrix, safety case (ARP4761), security case, pen‑test
08	Production‑Scale	Industrialization; rate readiness	PRR	Process FMEAs, SPC plans, MRP/ERP configs, golden routes
09	Ops‑Services	Entry into service; ops procedures	ORR	Ops manuals (S1000D/ATA), training packs, field data hooks
10	MRO	Maintenance, repair, overhaul	MRR	Scheduled/unscheduled maintenance specs, repair data, IPC
11	Sustainment‑Recycle	End‑of‑life, circularity, recycling	DR	Recycling plans, environmental dossiers, material passports

Formal note. Let \mathcal{A}_k be the artifact set at phase k. A phase transition k \to k\!+\!1 is allowed iff all exit predicates E_k(\mathcal{A}_k)=\text{true}. Concurrency is permitted for distinct CIs provided their interface contracts are frozen and composition predicates hold.

6. Optimization Doctrine over UTCS

6.1 Feasible‑First Enumeration

Define the design space \mathcal{X} (combinatorics over donors, subsystems, and layouts). Let hard constraints encode certifiability, physics, TRL gates, and compatibility:

\mathcal{F} \;=\; \{\, x\in\mathcal{X}\mid C_{\text{hard}}(x)=\textsf{true}\,\}

Enumeration uses MILP/CP‑SAT constrained by program artifacts (e.g., hard_constraints.yaml, candidates.yaml). The output is the finite feasible set feasible_set.json.

6.2 Risk‑Aware Selection

Given scenario‑dependent ecosystem cost H_s(x) (R&D, manufacturing, certification, infrastructure, training, maintenance, fuel/carbon, etc.), we select:

x^* \;=\; \arg\min_{x\in\mathcal{F}} \ \mathbb{E}s[H_s(x)] + \beta\,\mathrm{CVaR}\alpha\!\big(H_s(x)\big)

where \mathrm{CVaR}_\alpha is the Conditional Value at Risk at tail level \alpha\in(0,1); \beta\ge0 tunes risk aversion. We implement the selector via QAOA (one‑hot encoding over \mathcal{F}) or via classical surrogates when quantum hardware is unavailable.

Algorithm 1 (Sketch).
	1.	Build \mathcal{F} from constraints and donors.
	2.	For each x\in\mathcal{F}, estimate H_s(x) over scenarios s.
	3.	Solve \min \mathbb{E}[H]+\beta\,\mathrm{CVaR}_\alpha(H) with QAOA (depth p) or classical optimizer.
	4.	Return x^* and Pareto set.

7. Executable Artifacts (“as‑code”)

Artifacts are first‑class, versioned objects. Examples:
   •   Requirements (Phase 01): YAML with unique IDs, shall statements, units policy, standards mapping, and a V&V matrix (method, medium, criterion).
   •   Design (Phase 02): SysML exports, ICDs, pre‑sizes (FEM/CFD) with acceptance checks.
   •   Executables (Phase 04): Reproducible builds (binaries/containers), SBOMs, checksums, pipeline manifests.
   •   Verification & Qualification (05–06): Test records, P‑Δ curves, lightning/EMC results, GVT/Flutter reports.
   •   Certification‑Security (07): Compliance matrices, safety/cyber cases, red‑team results.

All artifacts are stored within a WBS‑backed file tree consistent with AMEDEO‑PELLICCIA (domains → CAs → CIs), making the repository itself a digital audit trail.

8. Case Study: AMPEL360‑H₂‑BWB‑Q

8.1 Program Overview
   •   Architecture: BWB structural base with LH₂ storage and turbofan propulsion.
   •   Doctrine: AMEDEO‑PELLICCIA taxonomy across all domains; UTCS phases 01–11 enforced.
   •   Optimization: Feasible‑first enumeration followed by risk‑aware selection with CVaR.

8.2 Requirements Example (Phase 01‑Requirements)

CI‑CA‑A‑001‑001 — CB‑PRIMARY‑GRID: Requirements capture (loads, aeroelastic, cryogenic, interfaces, LPS/EMC) with verification methods (analysis/test/inspection) and acceptance criteria. The specification is frozen at 01‑Requirements with an audit‑ready V&V matrix and standards alignment (e.g., structural loads, damage tolerance, EMC/lightning, hydrogen interfaces).

8.3 From Phase 01 to Phase 07
   •   02‑Design: Allocate requirements to structure; correlate FEM/GVT; derive ICDs for LH₂ mounts and thermal barriers.
   •   03‑Building‑Prototyping: Build coupons, sub‑components, cryo cycling rigs; run impact & residual strength tests.
   •   04‑Executables‑Packages: Produce validated solvers, configuration scripts, and data packages (loads envelopes, allowables, SBOMs).
   •   05‑Verification‑Validation: Close all shalls via analysis/test; validate evacuation and operational constraints.
   •   06‑Integration‑Qualification: Assemble representative center‑body; run qualification (pressure/EMC/lightning).
   •   07‑Certification‑Security: Deliver compliance statements and safety/cyber cases spanning design and operational domains.

9. Governance, Security, and Risk

9.1 Governance

Architecture and Safety Review Boards (ARB/SRB) operate with code‑native checklists bound to UTCS gates. Decisions are immutable, signed artifacts with cryptographic hashes stored alongside the repository state.

9.2 Security (Phase 07)

We couple certification with security by default (“Certification‑Security”):
   •   Design‑time: threat modeling of LH₂ + BWB‑specific interfaces, secure firmware baselines, and network segmentation.
   •   Test‑time: lightning indirect effects, EMC, and cyber pen‑testing artifacts aggregated into the security case.

9.3 Risk Quantification

Risk is expressed in the optimizer via CVaR and in operations via leading indicators (supplier maturity, corridor readiness, maintenance burden). Tail risk exposure drives the \beta parameter and informs investment sequencing.

10. Discussion and Limitations

Our doctrine assumes disciplined artifact curation and a reasonably stationary constraints set during feasible‑set enumeration; large mid‑stream requirement pivots can drive re‑enumeration costs. QAOA deployment is optional; classical surrogates are provided. Integration with external certification authorities remains program‑specific, though the as‑code approach eases audits.

⸻

11. Conclusion

We presented an executable systems engineering doctrine that unites a complete domain taxonomy (AMEDEO‑PELLICCIA), a canonical 11‑phase life‑cycle (UTCS), and a risk‑aware optimizer. Rendered as code, artifacts become verifiable, automatable, and auditable. Applied to AMPEL360‑H₂‑BWB‑Q, the doctrine produces a certifiable, risk‑optimized architecture with end‑to‑end traceability.
