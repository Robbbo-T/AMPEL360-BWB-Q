## Abstract

This paper formalizes a model-based, executable doctrine for complex aeronautical systems engineering that couples:  
(i) a domain taxonomy—the **AMEDEO-PELLICCIA methodology**—that makes large, multi-disciplinary programs tractable,  
(ii) a life-cycle process—**UTCS**, a set of 11 canonical phases spanning requirements through sustainment and recycling, and  
(iii) an optimization pipeline that enumerates a certifiable feasible set and selects architectures via risk-aware quantum/classical optimization.  

We instantiate the doctrine on a hydrogen-propelled Blended Wing Body (BWB) program, **AMPEL360-H₂-BWB-Q**, and show how requirements, verification, and governance artifacts are rendered as code (YAML/JSON), enabling audit-ready traceability from initial requirements to digital packages and certification security cases.  

**Contributions:**  
(a) a formal semantics for UTCS phases and artifacts,  
(b) an executable work-breakdown mapped to the AMEDEO-PELLICCIA domains, and  
(c) a mathematically precise selector using an \(E[cost] + \beta·CVaR_\alpha(cost)\) objective solved over a feasible set \(\mathcal{F}\) via QAOA or classical surrogates.

**Keywords:** UTCS, MBSE, ARP4754A/4761, BWB, hydrogen aviation, QAOA, CVaR, digital twin, certification security, executable requirements.

## 1. Introduction

Modern aerospace programs confront simultaneous pressures: decarbonization (e.g., liquid hydrogen), radical geometries (e.g., BWB), and highly coupled ecosystems (airports, supply chains, cyber-physical attack surfaces). Traditional document-centric methods struggle to keep pace, leading to ambiguities, late design churn, and certification surprises.  

We present an executable systems engineering doctrine that integrates a domain taxonomy, a canonical life-cycle, and a risk-aware optimizer into a single, auditable pipeline.  

**Thesis:**  
1. Program-level order arises from a complete, non-overlapping domain decomposition (AMEDEO-PELLICCIA).  
2. End-to-end rigor requires a canonical life-cycle with machine-checkable entry/exit criteria (UTCS—11 phases).  

With these foundations, optimization becomes tractable: we enumerate feasible, certifiable architectures and select a risk-optimal design using tail-risk aware objectives.

---

## 2. Contributions

1. **Methodological formalization.** AMEDEO-PELLICCIA domain taxonomy bound to CAs and CIs.  
2. **Canonical life-cycle.** UTCS—11 phases, each with code-representable inputs, artifacts, and exit criteria.  
3. **Optimization over certifiability.** Feasible-first pipeline:
   \[
   \mathcal{F}=\{x\in\mathcal{X}\mid \texttt{hard\_constraints}(x)=\text{true}\}
   \quad\rightarrow\quad
   x^*=\arg\min_{x\in\mathcal{F}} \ \mathbb{E}[H(x)] + \beta\,\mathrm{CVaR}_\alpha\!\big(H(x)\big)
   \]
   Implemented with QAOA or classical surrogates.  
4. **Executable traceability.** Requirements (e.g., `CI-CA-A-001-001-CB-PRIMARY-GRID`) captured, verified, and frozen with V&V matrices and standards mapping.

---

## 3. Background and Related Norms

Our doctrine interfaces with aerospace standards:  
- Development & safety: **ARP4754A, ARP4761**  
- Airworthiness: **CS/FAR-25** families  
- Environmental: **DO-160**  
- Lightning: **ARP5412/5414/5416**  
- Hydrogen: **ISO-19880, ISO-11114-4**  
- Materials: **CMH-17, MMPDS**  

We do not replace these norms; we bind them into an executable pipeline with explicit artifacts and acceptance criteria.

## 4. The AMEDEO-PELLICCIA Methodology (Domain Taxonomy)

### 4.1 Rationale
A large aerospace program is an entangled graph of domains. The taxonomy provides a complete, non-overlapping partition serving as ontology and schema for artifacts.

### 4.2 Domains
**Architecture, Mechanical, Environmental, Digital, Energy, Operations, Propulsion, Electronics, Logistics, Links, Infrastructures, Control, Cryogenics, Intelligence, Airports.**

Each domain contains **Configuration Architectures (CAs)** decomposed into **Configuration Items (CIs)** with unique IDs (e.g., `CA-A-001` → `CI-CA-A-001-001`). Artifacts (requirements, designs, ICDs, tests) are stored as code and versioned.

## 5. UTCS—11 Canonical Phases (Process Semantics)

| Phase | Name                   | Primary Objective                          | Gate | Exit Artifacts |
|-------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------|----------------|
| 01    | Requirements           | Stakeholder needs → requirements           | SRR  | Baseline REQs (YAML), standards mapping, V&V seed |
| 02    | Design                 | Functional/logical/physical design         | PDR/CDR | Models, ICDs, FEM/CFD, item REQs |
| 03    | Building-Prototyping   | Prototypes, coupons, rigs, breadboards     | BRR  | Build records, test rigs, prototype BoMs |
| 04    | Executables-Packages   | Software/firmware/data packages            | SW/HW PR | Builds, binaries, containers, SBOMs |
| 05    | Verification-Validation| Evidence vs. requirements                  | TR/VR | Test reports, validation evidence |
| 06    | Integration-Qualification| System integration & qualification      | IRR/QR | Integrated test logs, qual evidence |
| 07    | Certification-Security | Compliance, safety & cyber cases           | CR/ASR | Compliance matrix, safety/cyber case |
| 08    | Production-Scale       | Industrialization, rate readiness          | PRR  | Process FMEAs, SPC plans, configs |
| 09    | Ops-Services           | Entry into service, operations             | ORR  | Ops manuals, training packs |
| 10    | MRO                    | Maintenance, repair, overhaul              | MRR  | Maintenance specs, IPC |
| 11    | Sustainment-Recycle    | End-of-life, circularity                   | DR   | Recycling plans, material passports |

Formal rule: A phase transition \(k \to k+1\) is allowed iff all exit predicates \(E_k(\mathcal{A}_k)=\text{true}\). Concurrency allowed across CIs if interfaces are frozen.

## 6. Optimization Doctrine over UTCS

### 6.1 Feasible-First Enumeration
Design space \(\mathcal{X}\) filtered by hard constraints (certifiability, physics, TRL, compatibility):  
\[
\mathcal{F} = \{ x\in\mathcal{X}\mid C_{\text{hard}}(x)=\text{true} \}
\]  
Enumerated via **MILP/CP-SAT** → `feasible_set.json`.

### 6.2 Risk-Aware Selection
Scenario cost \(H_s(x)\). Select:
\[
x^* = \arg\min_{x\in\mathcal{F}} \ \mathbb{E}_s[H_s(x)] + \beta\,\mathrm{CVaR}_\alpha(H_s(x))
\]  
Implemented via **QAOA** (depth p) or classical optimizer.  

---

## 7. Executable Artifacts (“as-code”)

- **Requirements (01):** YAML, IDs, shall statements, V&V matrix.  
- **Design (02):** SysML, ICDs, FEM/CFD analyses.  
- **Executables (04):** Binaries, SBOMs, container manifests.  
- **Verification & Qualification (05–06):** Test logs, EMC/lightning data.  
- **Certification-Security (07):** Compliance, safety, cyber cases.  

Stored in **WBS-backed file trees**: Domains → CAs → CIs.

## 8. Case Study: AMPEL360-H₂-BWB-Q

### 8.1 Program Overview
- Architecture: BWB base with LH₂ storage + turbofan propulsion.  
- Doctrine: Taxonomy + UTCS phases 01–11.  
- Optimization: Feasible-first + CVaR-aware selection.  

### 8.2 Requirements Example
CI-CA-A-001-001 — CB-PRIMARY-GRID: Structural, cryogenic, aeroelastic, EMC requirements frozen with audit-ready V&V matrices.

### 8.3 Phase Progression
- 02-Design → FEM, ICDs, thermal barrier interfaces.  
- 03-Prototyping → Coupons, cryo rigs, impact tests.  
- 04-Executables → Solvers, SBOMs.  
- 05–07 → Validation, qualification, certification-security cases.

## 9. Governance, Security, and Risk

- **Governance:** ARB/SRB with cryptographic checklists, signed artifacts.  
- **Security (Phase 07):** Threat modeling, pen-testing, EMC/lightning indirect effects.  
- **Risk:** Optimizer CVaR + operational leading indicators.  

---

## 10. Discussion and Limitations

Doctrine assumes disciplined artifact curation; re-enumeration costly if requirements pivot. QAOA optional. Certification authority integration program-specific.

---

## 11. Conclusion

We presented an executable systems engineering doctrine combining:  
- Domain taxonomy (AMEDEO-PELLICCIA),  
- Canonical 11-phase life-cycle (UTCS),  
- Risk-aware optimization.  

Applied to AMPEL360-H₂-BWB-Q, the doctrine yields a certifiable, risk-optimized architecture with end-to-end traceability.
