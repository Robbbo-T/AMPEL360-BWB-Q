## Integration with Core Framework

This technological framework integrates with the core AMPEL360 framework components:

### Configuration Management Integration
- Links to `ampel360_config.json` for architecture decisions
- Interfaces with `data/candidates.yaml` for component selection
- Validates against `constraints/hard_constraints.yaml` for compliance

### Optimization Engine Integration
- Provides detailed component models for `scripts/qaoa_over_F.py`
- Supports CVaR risk assessment with component-level risk data
- Enables geometric integration validation

### Utility Framework Integration
- Extends `ampel360_utils.py` with architectural validation
- Provides detailed status reporting for each architectural domain
- Supports configuration change impact assessment

## Architecture Decision Framework

### Decision Hierarchy
1. **System Level**: Program Board decisions on major architectural approaches
2. **Domain Level**: Technical leads decide on domain-specific architectures
3. **Component Level**: Engineering teams select specific implementations
4. **Integration Level**: Cross-domain interface definitions and validation

### Traceability Matrix
Each architectural component maintains traceability to:
- System requirements and objectives
- Donor candidate selections (from candidates.yaml)
- Hard constraints compliance
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Verification and validation approaches

## Development Guidelines

### Naming Conventions
- **CA**: Component Architecture prefix for all AMPEL360 components
- **Domain Letter**: A=Architecture, M=Mechanical, E=Environmental, etc.
- **Sequential Numbering**: 001, 002, 003 for major subsystems
- **Component Items**: CI prefix for individual component implementations

### Documentation Standards
Each architectural component includes:
- **README.md**: Component overview and integration approach
- **requirements.yaml**: Component-specific requirements and constraints
- **interfaces.yaml**: Input/output interfaces and dependencies
- **validation.yaml**: Verification and validation criteria
- **risk-assessment.yaml**: Component-specific risk analysis

### Integration Standards
All components must:
- Comply with BWB geometric constraints
- Support hydrogen propulsion integration
- Maintain TRL requirements for current phase
- Provide quantum optimization interfaces
