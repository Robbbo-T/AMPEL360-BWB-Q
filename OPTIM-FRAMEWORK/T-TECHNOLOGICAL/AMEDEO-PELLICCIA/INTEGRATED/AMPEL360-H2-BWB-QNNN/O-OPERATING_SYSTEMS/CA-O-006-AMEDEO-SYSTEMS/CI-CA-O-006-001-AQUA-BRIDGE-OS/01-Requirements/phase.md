# 01-Requirements - CI-CA-O-006-001-AQUA-BRIDGE-OS

## Component Architecture: CA-O-006-AMEDEO-SYSTEMS
## Configuration Item: CI-CA-O-006-001-AQUA-BRIDGE-OS
## UTCS Phase: 01-Requirements

### Overview
This document outlines the requirements phase activities for the CI-CA-O-006-001-AQUA-BRIDGE-OS configuration item within the CA-O-006-AMEDEO-SYSTEMS component architecture.

AQUA-BRIDGE-OS v22.0 establishes the foundation for the first MOS (Mixed Operating System) tri-modal and multi-physical of the aerospace industry, implementing the Aerospace Digital Transponder (ADT) as part of AMEDEO Systems.

### Objectives
- Define AQUA-BRIDGE-OS v22.0 requirements for tri-modal operation
- Establish Triadic Computational Architecture (ACT) requirements
- Document Computación Circular Multi-Física (CCMF) paradigm requirements
- Define DAL-A certification framework requirements

### Core Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Implement tri-modal substrate support (Electronic, Photonic, Organic)
- **FR-002**: Support POAE loop (Perceive → Observe → Actuate → Evolve)
- **FR-003**: Provide 2oo3 redundancy (CPU+FPGA+DSP)
- **FR-004**: Implement ARINC 653 partitioning
- **FR-005**: Support Energy-as-Policy (EaP) framework

#### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: Control latency < 25 ms (target from baseline 50 ms)
- **PR-002**: Jitter ≤ 50 µs (P99.99) for DAL-A tasks
- **PR-003**: Availability > 99.9999% for DAL-A functions
- **PR-004**: MTBF > 10^9 hours for catastrophic failures

#### Safety Requirements
- **SR-001**: Compliance with DO-178C DAL-A
- **SR-002**: Compliance with DO-254 DAL-A
- **SR-003**: Support for safety-cases-as-code via Digital Evidence Twin (DET)
- **SR-004**: Isolation between flight and no-flight domains

### Deliverables
- [ ] AQUA-BRIDGE-OS requirements specification
- [ ] Triadic Computational Architecture specification
- [ ] CCMF paradigm definition
- [ ] Safety and certification requirements
- [ ] Interface requirements documentation
- [ ] Verification and validation evidence
- [ ] Configuration management records

### Phase Completion Criteria
- All deliverables completed and reviewed
- Technical specifications validated against AMEDEO Systems framework
- Safety requirements traced to DO-178C/DO-254
- Configuration management up to date
- Phase gate review passed

### Dependencies
- AMEDEO Systems framework definition
- AQUA-OS/ADT architecture baseline
- Certification authority guidance
- Hardware platform specifications

### Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Complexity of tri-modal integration
  - **Mitigation**: Phased implementation starting with Electronic substrate
- **Risk**: Certification compliance for novel architecture
  - **Mitigation**: Early engagement with certification authorities
- **Risk**: Performance requirements achievement
  - **Mitigation**: Prototype validation and iterative optimization
