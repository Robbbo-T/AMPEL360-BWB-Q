- **CA-O-005-MULTI-DOMAIN-OPS** - Multi-domain operational capabilities
- **CA-O-006-OPERATING-SYSTEMS** - Aerospace and Quantum United Applications OS (AQUA-OS)

## One-liner (mission)

**Unify the whole aerospace lifecycle—design (CAD/CAM/CAE/PLM), production (SCADA/ROS/NC), and operations/services (ATM, cockpit/FBW, nav/comm, MRO/EOL/procurement)—under a single, time-synchronized, evidence-producing, quantum-extensible operating fabric.**

---

## Elevator pitch

AQUA-OS BRIDGE v22.0 is a **mixed operating system (MOS)** and **integration fabric** that stitches together engineering tools, shop-floor systems, and flight/ground operations. It provides a **deterministic control plane** (ARINC-style partitioning + TSN), a **data/model fabric** with digital-twin contracts, **security & provenance by default** (DET evidence packs), and a **quantum abstraction layer (QAL)** for compute-heavy optimization—without replacing best-in-class domain tools.

---

## The unification model (what “under one OS” means)

* **Control plane:** Tri-modal MOS (Electronic/Photonic/Organic R\&D) with **time sync (TSP/PTP)** and **2oo3** voting for deterministic tasks.
* **Data & model fabric:** Typed schemas (Protobuf/Cap’n Proto), UTCS-MI traceability, versioned twins (engineering → manufacturing → ops).
* **Adapters, not rip-and-replace:** Canonical adapters for **CAD/CAM/CAE/PLM**, **SCADA/OPC UA**, **ROS 2**, **ARINC 429/653/AFDX/TSN**, **ATM/AOC**, **ERP/MES/MRO/Procurement**.
* **Security & evidence:** Zero-Trust, mTLS, signed artifacts, **Digital Evidence Twin (DET)** WORM logs.
* **Quantum-extensible:** **QAL** offloads non-RT optimization/scheduling to QPUs/simulators; *flight-critical remains classical DAL-A*.

## What gets unified (scope)

* **Development & Engineering:** CAD/PLM baselines become **versioned digital twins** that drive CAM toolpaths, CAE loads/cases, and test plans; changes propagate with **deterministic builds** and **traceable evidence**.
* **Production:** **SCADA/OPC UA** and **ROS 2** cells subscribe to the same twin contracts; schedules are optimized (optionally via QAL), and **DET** captures every run with signed telemetry.
* **Operations:** Cockpit/FBW interfaces remain **partitioned**; non-DAL services (EFB/maintenance, AOC, ATM data links) integrate through the bridge; **MRO/EOL** consume as-flown evidence for smarter workpack generation and recycling paths.

---

## Key capabilities

* **Time-synchronized, deterministic integration** across design→build→fly.
* **End-to-end provenance (DET):** every artifact/action is hash-anchored and audit-ready.
* **Model-centric APIs:** contract-first twins for geometry, processes, and states.
* **Policy-driven orchestration:** Energy-as-Policy, safety gates, and RBAC everywhere.
* **Quantum-ready optimization:** fleet-level scheduling, routing, inventory, layout—**offboard, non-RT**.

---

## Non-goals (explicit)

* Replacing CAD/CAM/CAE/PLM or avionics stacks.
* Hosting **flight-critical** control on quantum hardware.
* Bypassing certification boundaries: **DAL-A stays classical and partitioned**.

---

## Example cross-lifecycle flows

1. **Design change → Shop floor → MRO**
   PLM change (CAD/CAE) → twin diff → CAM & ROS cells updated → run captured in DET → as-built config sync → MRO workpack auto-generated with actual TORQUE/LOT evidence.

2. **Ops feedback → Engineering**
   In-service defects (MRO/DET) → analytics → CAE model update → new design & process plan → controlled rollout with SBOM + evidence.

---

## KPIs (measurable)

* **Lead time** concept→first article: −30–50% (repeatable pipelines).
* **Evidence latency:** DET pack available **< T+5 min** after run.
* **Sync quality:** TSP phase RMS **≤ 500 ps** across nodes (p99).
* **Energy/CO₂** vs baseline: −20–40% via **Energy-as-Policy** scheduling.
* **Mean plan reproducibility:** 100% with same seed & inputs (hash-stable).

---

## v22.0 deliverables (what’s in this release)

* **Control plane** (particionamiento, TSN profile, TSP sync) for ground/industrial domains; avionics integrations via **partitioned gateways**.
* **Data/model fabric** (schemas, twin APIs, registry) + **UTCS-MI** traceability.
* **DET** (WORM evidence, signed logs) integrated CI/CD and shop-floor.
* **Adapter set**: CAD/PLM, OPC UA/SCADA, ROS 2, ERP/MES/MRO, ARINC/AFDX gateways.
* **QAL (non-RT)** for optimization workloads (planning/scheduling/layout).

> **Out-of-scope v22.0:** Organic substrate in flight, DAL certification of quantum components, and replacement of proprietary CAD/PLM/ATM stacks.

---

## Why it matters (strategic)

* **Single source of truth:** the twin and its evidence, not the document, is the contract.
* **Determinism + agility:** you get safety-critical rigor *and* rapid iteration.
* **Sustainability baked in:** energy/CO₂ becomes an enforceable policy, not a slide.
