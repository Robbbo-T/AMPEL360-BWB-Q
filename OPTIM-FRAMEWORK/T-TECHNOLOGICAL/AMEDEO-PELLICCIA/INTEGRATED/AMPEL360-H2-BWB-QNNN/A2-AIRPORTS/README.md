# A2-AIRPORTS — Index (AMPEL360-H₂-BWB-QNNN)

[← Integrated Index](../)

Airport-side infrastructure for LH₂ BWB operations: storage and handling, ground procedures, turnaround, and safety corridors. Each **Configuration Architecture (CA)** links to its UTCS life-cycle artifacts (01–11).

## Conventions

- Keep UTCS folder names exactly as shown (`UTCS-01-Requirements` … `UTCS-11-Sustainment-Recycle`).  
- Each CA should include a short `README.md` per UTCS phase and store artifacts as code (YAML/JSON, analyses, test logs).
