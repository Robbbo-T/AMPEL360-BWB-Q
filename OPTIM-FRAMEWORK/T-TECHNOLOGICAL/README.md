## Integration with AMPEL360 Framework

### Configuration Management Integration
The technological framework is fully integrated with the existing AMPEL360 configuration management system:

```python
# Example integration with ampel360_config.json
from ampel360_utils import AMPEL360Config

config = AMPEL360Config()
architecture = config.get_architecture()

# Map to technological framework components
tech_framework = {
    'center_body': f"CA-A-001 (Donor {architecture['fuselage']})",
    'outboard_wing': f"CA-A-002 (Donor {architecture['wing']})", 
    'propulsion': f"CA-P-001 (Donor {architecture['propulsion']})",
    'energy': f"CA-E2-005 (Donor {architecture['energy']})",
    'digital': f"CA-D-005 (Quantum Computing)",
    'cryogenics': f"CA-C2-001 (Hâ‚‚ Systems)"
}
```

### QAOA Optimization Integration
Each technological component is optimized through the QAOA-based selection process:

```python
# Component optimization mapping
component_mapping = {
    'qaoa_variables': {
        'fuselage_donor': 'CA-A-001-xxx',
        'wing_donor': 'CA-A-002-xxx',
        'propulsion_donor': 'CA-P-001-xxx',
        'energy_donor': 'CA-E2-005-xxx'
    },
    'constraints': {
        'structural_compatibility': 'CA-A-xxx interfaces',
        'systems_integration': 'CA-xxx-xxx compatibility',
        'safety_requirements': 'All CA-xxx safety compliance'
    }
}
```
