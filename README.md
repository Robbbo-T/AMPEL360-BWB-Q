I am an aerospace systems engineer architecting the next generation of certifiable, sustainable aircraft. My work bridges the gap between rigorous, safety-critical engineering and advanced computational paradigms like digital twins, AI, and quantum-inspired optimization. The goal is to transform aerospace complexity into computational certainty. My primary focus is the development of the **AMPEL360-BWB-Q** framework, a comprehensive system for designing the future of flight.

An algorithmic framework for **hydrogen Blended Wing Body (BWB)** aircraft configuration. It is designed to navigate an astronomically large design space through systematic decomposition and intelligent, risk-aware selection.

### The Challenge: A Combinatorial Explosion

Designing a novel aircraft like a hydrogen BWB involves integrating numerous subsystems, each with its own constraints. The challenge is not just technical but combinatorial.

- **43 Donor Subsystems:** a pool of pre-validated components from existing aircraft  
- **10 Major Integration Slots:** key architectural components that must be filled  
- **Resulting Search Space:** `43^10 = 21,611,482,313,284,249 ≈ 2.16 × 10^16` configurations — far beyond manual trade studies or brute-force computation

### The Solution: A Two-Stage Optimization Pipeline

**Stage 1: Feasible-First Enumeration**  
First, we prune the impossible. Using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Constraint Programming (CP-SAT) solvers, we apply hundreds of real-world engineering, safety, and compatibility constraints to eliminate all non-viable designs.

```python
# Illustrative MILP/CP-SAT Constraint Definition
constraints = {
    'trl_gates': {'wing': 6, 'fuselage': 6, 'propulsion': 6},
    'compatibility': allowed_pairs_matrix,
    'physics': {'max_weight_factor': 0.65, 'min_twr': 0.55},
    'safety': {'max_evacuation_time_seconds': 90}
}
```

**Stage 2: Risk-Aware Selection (CVaR)**
From the remaining thousands of feasible candidates, we select the best one. Using Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), the objective is to minimize not just the expected cost, but the **tail-risk** — e.g., catastrophic budget overruns due to future H₂ infrastructure delays.

```text
# CVaR Objective Function: minimize E[cost] + λ × CVaR_α(cost)
α = 0.8   # Optimize for the worst 20% of possible future scenarios
λ = 0.25  # Risk aversion weight against H₂ infrastructure delays
```

### Implementation Status

* ✅ **Feasible Set Generation:** the initial \~`2.16 × 10^16` space is reduced to \~10,000 viable candidates in \~3 hours
* ✅ **CVaR Optimization:** risk-adjusted optimum selected from the feasible set in \~15 minutes
* ✅ **Test Coverage:** 92.3%
* ✅ **UTCS-MI Compliance:** 245 Configuration Items are 100% traced from requirement to implementation
* → **Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Testing:** scheduled for Q2 2026 to validate models against real-time hardware

**Principle: strict separation of intelligence**

* **I-INTELLIGENT (Autonomous Intelligence):** proactive, goal-driven systems (e.g., ExMCP) that decide and create without explicit triggers
* **M-MACHINE (Classical Machine Learning):** reactive, supervised models trained on labeled data to perform predictable tasks (e.g., predictive maintenance)
