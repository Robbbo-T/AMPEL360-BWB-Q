## UTCS Phase Implementation
Each of the 293 Configuration Items contains all 11 UTCS phases:
1. 01-Requirements
2. 02-Architecture  
3. 03-Design
4. 04-Implementation
5. 05-Integration
6. 06-Validation
7. 07-Deployment
8. 08-Operations
9. 09-Maintenance
10. 10-Enhancement
11. 11-Sustainment-Recycle

## Phase Documentation
Each phase includes:
- **phase.md**: Comprehensive documentation with objectives, deliverables, criteria, dependencies, and risks
- **phase-data.yaml**: Structured data tracking with status, metrics, approvals, and metadata

## Compliance with Requirements
- ✅ Complete tree structure (CAs and all CIs)
- ✅ Every CI contains all 11 UTCS phases
- ✅ Each phase has both phase.md and phase-data.yaml files
- ✅ Proper naming conventions maintained
- ✅ Hierarchical organization preserved
- ✅ No missing directories or files

## Technical Implementation
The structure was generated using an automated Python script that:
- Created all directory hierarchies systematically
- Generated consistent documentation templates
- Populated YAML data structures with proper metadata
- Ensured complete coverage of all requirements
