- **Risk Assessment**: CVaR-based risk evaluation

## Usage Guidelines

### For System Architects
1. Review domain-specific README files for system overviews
2. Examine CA items for major subsystem decisions
3. Use CI items for detailed implementation options
4. Consider cross-domain integration requirements

### For Optimization Engineers
1. Use CA/CI structure for component alternative definition
2. Apply TRL constraints for feasibility checking
3. Incorporate cost and performance data
4. Validate integration constraints

### For Certification Engineers
1. Map requirements to specific CA/CI items
2. Trace compliance evidence
3. Identify certification-critical components
4. Plan verification and validation activities
