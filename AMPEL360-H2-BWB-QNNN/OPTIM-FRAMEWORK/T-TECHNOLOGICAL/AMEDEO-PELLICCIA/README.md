# AMEDEO-PELLICCIA Methodology

## Methodology Overview

The AMEDEO-PELLICCIA methodology represents a comprehensive approach to aircraft system design and optimization, specifically developed for advanced configurations like the AMPEL360 H₂-BWB-QNNN.

## Methodology Principles

### Systematic Coverage
The methodology ensures complete coverage of all aircraft systems through 14 carefully defined domains, preventing gaps in design and optimization.

### Hierarchical Structure
- **Components**: Top-level system domains (A, M, E, D, E2, O, P, E3, L, L2, I, C, C2, I2)
- **Component Architecture (CA)**: Major subsystems within each domain
- **Component Items (CI)**: Specific implementations and configurations

### Integration Focus
The methodology emphasizes integration between domains, recognizing that modern aircraft are complex systems-of-systems.

## Domain Definitions

2. **P2 - Introduce BWB**: BWB-specific adaptations
3. **P3 - Full Optimal**: Advanced optimizations

### Optimization Integration
The methodology integrates with the QAOA optimization framework to:
- Define component alternatives
- Establish compatibility constraints
- Enable systematic configuration exploration
- Support risk-adjusted optimization

### Certification Alignment
Each domain maps to certification requirements:
- CS-25/FAR-25 compliance
- Hydrogen-specific regulations
- BWB certification considerations
- Safety and reliability requirements

## Benefits

### Traceability
Provides clear traceability from high-level requirements to specific implementations.

### Optimization
Enables systematic optimization across all aircraft systems.

### Scalability
Supports everything from conceptual design to detailed implementation.

### Integration
Facilitates integration across traditional organizational boundaries.
