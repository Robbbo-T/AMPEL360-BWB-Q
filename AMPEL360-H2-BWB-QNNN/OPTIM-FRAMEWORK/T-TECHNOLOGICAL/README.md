# T-TECHNOLOGICAL Framework

## Overview
The Technological Framework implements the complete AMEDEO-PELLICCIA methodology for the AMPEL360 H₂-BWB-QNNN aircraft program.

## AMEDEO-PELLICCIA Methodology

The methodology provides systematic coverage of all aircraft systems through 14 core domains:

**A**rchitecture · **M**echanical · **E**nvironmental · **D**igital · **E**nergy · **O**perations · **P**ropulsion · **E**lectronics · **L**ogistics · **L**inks · **I**nfrastructures · **C**ontrol · **C**ryogenics · **I**ntelligence

## Component Architecture (CA) Structure

Each domain follows a consistent structure:
- **CA-X-NNN-COMPONENT-NAME**: Component Architecture items
- **CI-CA-X-NNN-NNN-ITEM-NAME**: Component Items within each CA

## Integration with AMPEL360 Framework

This technological framework integrates with the parent optimization framework through:

1. **Configuration Management**: Links to `ampel360-config.yaml`
2. **Constraint Validation**: TRL gates and compatibility checks
3. **Optimization Engine**: QAOA-based component selection
4. **Results Analysis**: Performance and cost evaluation

## Usage

1. Navigate to specific domains for detailed component information
2. Review CA items for architectural decisions
3. Examine CI items for implementation details
4. Use for optimization constraint development
5. Reference for certification compliance

## BWB-Specific Considerations

The framework is specifically adapted for Blended Wing Body (BWB) aircraft with:
- Modified structural arrangements
- Integrated passenger/cargo spaces
- Unique systems routing
- BWB-specific control systems

## Hydrogen Propulsion Integration

Special attention to hydrogen-specific systems:
- Cryogenic storage and handling
- Hydrogen-compatible materials
- Safety systems and protocols
- Infrastructure requirements
