# AMPEL360 Program Charter v1.0

## Executive Summary
The AMPEL360 H₂-BWB QNNN program represents a transformational approach to commercial aviation through the development of a hydrogen-powered blended wing body aircraft optimized using quantum-inspired algorithms.

## Program Vision
To develop the world's first commercially viable hydrogen-powered blended wing body aircraft that revolutionizes aviation sustainability while maintaining operational excellence and passenger safety.

## Program Mission
Design, develop, and certify the AMPEL360 H₂-BWB aircraft through systematic application of the AMEDEO-PELLICCIA methodology, achieving optimal passenger capacity (QNNN) through advanced optimization techniques.

## Strategic Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Zero Carbon Operations**: Achieve net-zero carbon emissions through hydrogen propulsion
2. **Operational Excellence**: Maintain commercial aviation safety and reliability standards
3. **Economic Viability**: Deliver competitive operating economics compared to conventional aircraft
4. **Certification Compliance**: Achieve CS-25/FAR-25 certification with hydrogen appendices

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Technology Leadership**: Establish leadership in sustainable aviation technology
2. **Supply Chain Innovation**: Develop hydrogen aviation supply chain infrastructure
3. **Market Transformation**: Enable transition to sustainable commercial aviation
4. **Stakeholder Value**: Deliver value to all program stakeholders
